Initium Potentia

Otherwise known as “Default users” Initium Potentia is considered the most fundamental species in the ecosystem, often referred to as the "baseline" subspecies as they are what each species evolved from and were what began the ecosystem of Ability Wars. They are simple and have everything for survival but lack any special enhancements like other species, basically meaning that they are utterly useless in the wild.
These specimens are typically neutral and adaptable. However, due to their lack of advanced abilities, they are often outperformed by more evolved species in direct confrontations and serve as a lower species on the food-chain.
Initium Potentia generally exhibits steady and straightforward behavior, focusing on basic actions and movement. When threatened or in competitive environments, they maintain their basic attack patterns but lack the capacity for significant escalation. They are often targeted by more advanced species due to their simplicity. Common predators include abilities with advanced offensive or defensive mechanisms, such as Cofferia Tylum (coffee mains), Mentis Nexus (Hivemind users), and Animae Vorator (Dos mains).
There are not many specimens of this species, as it is rarely found in the wild.
