Cofferia Tylum

Commonly known as “Coffee mains” Cofferia Tylum are referred to as "newly discovered" subspecies, They're called this way, 
due to them having a different molecular structure, mostly made of Caffeine, phosphofructokinase, and diethylcarbamazine. 
Those specimens tend to be calm at first, but when they drink coffee...That's when disaster strikes. 
They get overcharged with such adrenaline that they need to take all of their energy out on certain targets. 
Some of these victims are: Engineers. Statics.(trash) Mechs. and most importantly DOS's. (soulless).
