Fizzus Refreshis
Known as “Soda users”' this species was the first to evolve from Initium Potentia and has since been one of the most common species in the ecosystem. 
They have a different molecular structure, like that of Cofferia Tylum, but it is made of the same ingredients of Soda. Usually they are inexperienced, and unintelligent creatures, who only will go for the nearest victim and try to attack, running away if they fail. 
They share a similar speed to coffee, except they are faster, can jump higher, and have a special ability where they can repel themselves from their enemies with a blast of soda, which also pushes their enemy. 
This blast of soda can be used many times, with a short frame of time between them, and is thought to come from an organ in their body that is able to reproduce mass amounts of soda as their heart pumps blood.
They have a similar dilemma with coffee, drinking a mass amount of soda, to keep them alive.
There are many specimens of this species, and it is thought that since they have evolved from Initium Potentia, that they have overpopulated the ecosystem of Ability Wars.
They share a huge rivalry with Cofferia Tylum, and Energium Boostis, and constantly attack those species.
